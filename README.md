# dockerthingy
An demonstration docker compose project used in the "Docker from Scratch" blog post series: 

http://deninet.com/tags/docker-scratch

This is a demonstration container set. It's designed to be self-contained, and as minimal as possible while being a 
functional environment in which to run Drupal 8. As such, it does *not* follow all of Docker best practices for
educational purposes. 

While you can use this container set for your Drupal development environment, it is not the fastest, easiest, or
best solution. Again, the purpose was to unravel Dockerfiles, and docker-compose.yml. See Drude, Bowline, dropdock, 
or other existing container sets for a Drupal-dedicated environment.

This repository was built as the blog post series was being written. Please examine the git history to see how the
container set evolved over the course of the series.
